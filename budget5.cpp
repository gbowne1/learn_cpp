//BUDGET5.CPP - Budget program with inheritance and
//              late binding (aka polymorphism).   Notice
//              how much smallter the program is now that the
//              redundancy has been removed.  A single
//              function can now handle both checking and
//              savings accounts (and any other accounts that
//              you might invent in the future).
